# Serial Logging
The priorities for any system logging field data in real-time are simplicity and stability.

This repo contains scripts and instructions to log on Linux/Windows.

This has been a work-in-progress since c. 2003, original code in VB.net.

All current code is in Python 3.9 and has been cut down to base minimums.

Linux scripts are *.sh and are tested on RPi and ubuntu only.
